# linear_algebra
This repository contains fundamental aspects of linear algebra to understand machine learning algorithms

Importances aspects of LA in ML:

- The use of linear algebra structures when working with data such as tabular datasets and
images.
- Linear algebra concepts when working with data preparation such as one hot encoding
and dimensionality reduction.
- The in-grained use of linear algebra notation and methods in subfields such as deep
learning, natural language processing and recommender systems.
