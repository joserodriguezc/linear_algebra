This repository contains fundamental aspects of linear algebra (LA) to understand machine learning (ML) algorithms

Importances aspects of LA in ML:

- The use of linear algebra structures when working with data such as tabular datasets and
images.
- Linear algebra concepts when working with data preparation such as one hot encoding
and dimensionality reduction.
- The in-grained use of linear algebra notation and methods in subfields such as deep
learning, natural language processing and recommender systems.

Some examples of LA in ML are:
1. Dataset and Data Files
2. Images and Photographs
3. One Hot Encoding
4. Linear Regression
5. Regularization
6. Principal Component Analysis
7. Singular-Value Decomposition
8. Latent Semantic Analysis
9. Recommender Systems
10. Deep Learning
